              Sydria Hasler is a blank slate. After a tragic accident, her
              images of the past have vanished. All she wants is to get her
              memory back and return homeâ€”wherever home is. But the more she
              rebuilds her past, the more she wants to fight for a future with
              King Marx. Too bad it's all a sham.

              King Marx McKane has never cared about anyone or anything,
              especially being king. When his father forces him to marry a
              mysterious woman, he starts taking things seriously. The only way
              out of his arranged marriage is to pretend that he's falling in
              love with his wife. This charade might end up being the most
              reckless thing Marx has ever done. Is he willing to sacrifice his
              life and his kingdom to set Sydria free?

              selves, or will deception cost them their freedom?
